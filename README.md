The ft_printf project consists in recreating the standard printf() function from the C library while following the 42 Norm and using only a limited set of authorized functions. Its goal is to understand how printf works internally, including the handling of variadic arguments, type conversions, and formatted output. This implementation supports several format specifiers (%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %%) and returns the total number of characters printed. The project strengthens core skills in string manipulation, memory management, and algorithmic logic, while laying the groundwork for more advanced C projects in the 42 curriculum.
